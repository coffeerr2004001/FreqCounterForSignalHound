# FreqCounterForSignalHound

A frequency counter app write by c# for Signalhound spectrum analyzer.

SignalHound spectrum analyzer can work with 0.1hz rbw, and can use external reference source,
these make it well suited to test clock frequency instead of a universal clock counter,
so I build this project to meet people with similar needs.

this project was create by vs2015 free version and was tested on my sa44b device.
Some modifications maybe necessory when using other Signalhound devices.
